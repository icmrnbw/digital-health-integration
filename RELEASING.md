# Releasing

Publishing a release is automated by [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml).

## Steps

1. **Prepare-release PR.** Open a PR that:
   - bumps `version:` in `sushi-config.yaml` to `X.Y.Z`,
   - bumps the `uz.dhp.core` dependency to the core release this version builds
     against, and
   - rolls the changelog `### In development` section into a `### Version X.Y.Z`
     section (en/ru/uz), resetting *In development* to `(No changes yet)`.

   A new core version only resolves once UZ Core has released it and its package
   feed PR is merged, because CI installs `uz.dhp.core` from packages.fhir.org.
   Check <https://packages.fhir.org/uz.dhp.core> lists the version before
   pushing the bump, or `ig-publisher` fails on an unresolvable dependency.

   Merge it once CI is green.

2. **Tag the release commit** on `main` and push the tag:

   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git tag X.Y.Z && git push origin X.Y.Z
   ```

3. The **Release** workflow then automatically:
   - builds the IG as a publication build (`-publish https://dhp.uz/fhir/integrations`),
   - verifies the built package is `uz.dhp.integrations#X.Y.Z` (and that the tag
     matches `sushi-config.yaml`), is not flagged `notForPublication` and has the
     `https://dhp.uz/fhir/integrations` url - packages2.fhir.org rejects draft
     packages,
   - creates the GitHub Release `X.Y.Z` with `package.tgz` attached, and
   - opens a PR adding `X.Y.Z` to [`docs/package-feed.xml`](docs/package-feed.xml)
     so the FHIR package registry discovers it.

4. **dhp.uz publishes the release on its own.** A GitLab instance pull-mirrors
   this repository and runs the publication build there, so GitHub stays the
   source of truth and there is nothing to trigger by hand. The mirror polls
   every 30 minutes and an integrations build takes 48-78 minutes, so allow up
   to an hour and a half from pushing the tag before
   `https://dhp.uz/fhir/integrations/X.Y.Z/` appears and
   `https://dhp.uz/fhir/integrations/` starts serving it. Until then the tag is
   only on GitHub.

   The published build reports a few more QA findings than CI did, because
   `-go-publish` revalidates against a cold terminology cache. On the publishing
   host, `ci/verify-site.sh https://dhp.uz integrations <previous> X.Y.Z` checks
   the result and `ci/release-rollback.sh X.Y.Z` undoes it; the pipeline and
   those scripts live in
   [dhp-gitlab-publishing](https://github.com/vadi2/dhp-gitlab-publishing).

5. **Merge the package-feed PR.** The Release workflow opens it with
   `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and events from that token start no workflows, so the
   required `sushi` and `ig-publisher` checks never report and the ruleset
   blocks the merge. Push any commit to its branch to make them run:

   ```bash
   BRANCH=chore/package-feed-X.Y.Z
   git fetch origin $BRANCH && git checkout $BRANCH
   git commit --allow-empty -m "run checks" && git push
   ```

   Auto-merge is already armed by the workflow, so the PR merges itself shortly
   after the checks pass; merge it by hand if it has not. The squash drops the
   extra commit.

6. **Announce the release.** Send one email to the implementation teams and to
   the Civitta review covering both guides when UZ Core released the same
   version, rather than one email each, and post the same announcement to the
   implementation Telegram group in Russian. Send it once the package feed PR is
   merged, so the version is installable when people go looking for it.

   The announcement needs the version and package coordinates
   (`uz.dhp.integrations#X.Y.Z`), a short summary written from the
   `### Version X.Y.Z` changelog section, the breaking changes spelled out, and
   links to the [guide](https://dhp.uz/fhir/integrations), the
   [changelog](https://dhp.uz/fhir/integrations/changelog.html) and the GitHub
   release.

`main` is ruleset-protected (PR + `sushi`/`ig-publisher` checks required), so the
feed change must go through a PR rather than a direct push.

## Registration

Both guides are already discoverable, and nothing per release is needed. The
GitLab pipeline publishes one site-level feed, <https://dhp.uz/package-feed.xml>,
listing every `uz.dhp.core` and `uz.dhp.integrations` release, and that feed is
the one registered in
[FHIR/ig-registry](https://github.com/FHIR/ig-registry/blob/master/package-feeds.json);
the registry crawls it and publishes each new version itself. The guide is listed
at [fhir.org/guides/registry](https://fhir.org/guides/registry) through its
`fhir-ig-list.json` entry there.
